# pokemon-app
This is a Flutter application that parses pokemon JSON data and shows all the pokemon from the JSON data in a grid of cards. There is also an option to filter which pokemon are shown by type.

## Motivation
I wanted to practice loading and parsing JSON data from the internet. Also, I wanted to learn about Future widgets in Flutter and how to manipulate the data locally after the application received it. I wanted to learn how to create custom animated widgets.
